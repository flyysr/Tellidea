		Too many unhappy things make us learn to complain , <br>
		but forget to make the change to live a better life!<br>
		One day, I walk and walk along with the sea side,<br>
		Calm down,<br>
		and still face the life with a smile face, <br>
		study hard,<br>
		go for the goal---to be a better man,<br>
		little by little,<br>
		block by block,<br>
		day by day,<br>
		then I  find the life is not the way I always think,<br>
		instead, it is so sweet  that  I really has fallen in love with.<br>
