Too many unhappy things make us learn to complain , <br>
but forget to make the change to live a better life!<br>


One day, i walk and walk along the sea side,<br>

Calm dwon,<br>

and still face the life with a smile face, <br>

study hard,<br>

go for your goal-to be a better man,<br>

little by little,<br>

block by block,<br>

day by day,<br>

then you will find the life is so sweat which you really love<br>

and you grow up to be the better man <br>

and you will get there:-)
