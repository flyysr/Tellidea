<div style="margin-left:50px;"><h2>The Life's Look<h2><div>
Too many unhappy things make us learn to complain , <br>
but forget to make the change to live a better life!<br>
One day, I walk and walk along the sea side,<br>
Calm dwon,<br>
and still face the life with a smile face, <br>
study hard,<br>
go for the goal-to be a better man,<br>
little by little,<br>
block by block,<br>
day by day,<br>
then I  find the life is not the way I alway think,<br>
instead, it is so sweat  that  I really has fallen in love with.<br>
:-) <br>
