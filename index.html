Too many unhappy things make us learn to complain , 
but forget to make the change to live a better life!

One day, i walk and walk along the sea side,
Calm dwon,
and still face the life with a smile face, 
study hard,
go for your goal-to be a better man,
little by little,
block by block,
day by day,
then you will find the life is so sweat which you really love
and you grow up to be the better man :-)
